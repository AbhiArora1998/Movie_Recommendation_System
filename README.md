# Movie_recommendation_system
1) Here I have built a project that recommends movies to a new user and add labels to a new data with the help of KNN and k-means algorithm
2) In the Code 
  - First the features are being selected to do the KNN and K-means clustering 
  - Once the dataset has been selected we need to do pre-processing that helps us to get the data ready to start pridicting 
  - Once the pre-processing is done, we K-means clustering to provide labels to the unlabel dataset that we have through dataset
  - Once we have our dataset and label ready it is time to predict the which family a new upcoming data belongs to 
  - On the other hand, finding movie that are closer to the certain family on the basis of Eculedian distance. 
  - With neighbors are found we can recommend those movies and save it for future reference
